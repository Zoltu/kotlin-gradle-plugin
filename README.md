# kotlin-gradle-plugin
An unofficial release of the official Kotlin Gradle Plugin.  The only reason this exists is because JetBrains doesn't yet publish the kotlin plugin to [plugins.gradle.org](plugins.gradle.org).  Once https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-5756 is resolved, this plugin will no longer be necessary.

## Maintenance

### Syncing with Official Plugin Version

Change [this line](https://github.com/Zoltu/kotlin-gradle-plugin/blob/master/build.gradle#L8) to match the current release of the official kotlin plugin publised to maven central.
